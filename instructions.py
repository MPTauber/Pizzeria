#Start a new project called Pizzeria with an app called pizzas.

#Define a model Pizza with a field called name, which will hold name values, such as Hawaiian and Meat Lovers.

#Define a model called Topping with fields called pizza and name. The pizza field should be a foreign key to Pizza, 
# and name should be able to hold values such as pineapple, Canadian bacon, and sausage.

#Register both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some pizza names and toppings.

#Pizzeria Home Page: Add a creative home page to your project to replace the Django default home page
